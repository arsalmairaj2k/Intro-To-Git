# Hello, I'm Arsal Mairaj! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a Computer Science student at FAST University, specializing in robotics. Currently, I'm part of an exciting journey with AI Skillbridge, a prestigious program that selected 100 students to learn cutting-edge AI technologies.

## AI Skillbridge Journey
I'm fortunate to be among the 100 selected students in the AI Skillbridge program, where I'm focusing on Agentic AI. This opportunity has opened new horizons in my understanding of artificial intelligence and its practical applications.

## What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI represents a new paradigm in artificial intelligence where AI systems act as autonomous agents capable of:
- Making independent decisions
- Understanding and executing complex tasks
- Learning from interactions and feedback
- Adapting to new situations and requirements
- Working collaboratively with humans as intelligent assistants

Unlike traditional AI systems that follow rigid, predefined rules, Agentic AI systems can:
- Understand context and nuance
- Plan and execute multi-step tasks
- Handle uncertainty and ambiguity
- Maintain ongoing conversations and task states
- Take initiative when appropriate while respecting human guidance

## Current Project
This repository contains my work on a Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation using Python and Pygame. It's a practical exercise in:
- Game development fundamentals
- AI opponent implementation
- User interface design
- Event handling and game state management

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pygame
- Asyncio for game loop management
